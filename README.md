# accessing-text-only

in most browser
.textContent collects the word fresh figs
.innerHtml just show figs
(because fresh was hidden by the css)

but:
.in IE8 or earlier the textContent property does not work
.in firefox the innerText property will return undefined because the it was never implemented in firefox more info at the file js
